<h4><u>Html</u></h4>
<p>In <b>1990</b>, as part of his vision of the Web, Tim Berners-Lee defined the 
concept of hypertext, which Berners-Lee formalized the following year through a markup<br> mainly based on <strong>SGML</strong>. 
The IETF began formally specifying HTML in 1993, and after several drafts released version 2.0 in 1995. In 1994 Berners-Lee founded the W3C to develop the Web. In 1996, the W3C took over the HTML work and published the HTML 3.2 recommendation 
a year later.</p>  <p> <i>HTML 4.0 was released in 1999 and became an ISO standard in 2000.</i></p>
<h4><u>HTML5</u></h4>
<p>
<em>HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML.</em></p>  <p>
The term represents two different concepts. It is a new version of the language HTML, with new elements, attributes, and behaviors, and a larger set of technologies that allows the building of more diverse and powerful Web sites and applications.
This set is sometimes called <strong>HTML5 & friends and often shortened to just HTML5</strong>.

<h3><strong>HTML5 is classified into :</strong></h3>

	<li><i>Connectivity</i>: allowing you to communicate with the server in new and innovative ways.</li>
